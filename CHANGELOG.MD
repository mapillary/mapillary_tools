## 0.0.0 (2018-05-30)


### Breaking changes

* The library has been rewritten for this initial release. The library usage is different from before. Refer to the documentation in the [README](https://github.com/mapillary/mapillary_tools/blob/mapillary_tools_v2/README.md) for instructions on requirement installation and usage. Due to an incompatible logging procedure, previous tools need to be used to finish uploading any sequences that were partially uploaded with the previous tools.

### Features and improvements
* Improved authentication procedure
* Improved user interface with only one executable that can run several basic tools with basic arguments, as well as advanced tools and/or advanced arguments
* Improved logging procedure
* Simpler installation with pip
* Modules can be imported in Python to enable easier development of custom process and/or upload scripts
