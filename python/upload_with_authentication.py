'''
Script for uploading images taken with other cameras than
the Mapillary iOS or Android apps.

Intended use is for when you have used an action camera such as a GoPro
or Garmin VIRB, or any other camera where the location is included in the image EXIF.

The following EXIF tags are required:
-GPSLongitude
-GPSLatitude
-(GPSDateStamp and GPSTimeStamp) or DateTimeOriginal or DateTimeDigitized or DateTime
-Orientation

Before uploading put all images that belong together in a sequence, in a
specific folder, for example using 'time_split.py'. All images in a session
will be considered part of a single sequence.

NB: DO NOT USE THIS SCRIPT ON IMAGE FILES FROM THE MAPILLARY APPS,
USE UPLOAD.PY INSTEAD.

(assumes Python 2.x, for Python 3.x you need to change some module names)
